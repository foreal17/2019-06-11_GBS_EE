We learn the basics of bash. Those are .. of everuday..

In this exercise, we will try to **reinforce our skills, touch base with genomics and appreciate the power of the command line**.

Which files are in there?
Someone left you the human genome in there as a fasta file:

short description of a fasta....

Can you print all the sequence names to the screen ?

Can you tell me the total length of the genome?

Hint: Can you find eveything BUT the sequence names? You only have to count the characters now, can you remember how to count the lines?


What is the length of chromosome 5?
Hint : Find chrosome five, use the -A option of the grep function once you looked in the help to print more than the line you found. You just need to get ride of the sequence name, but you already did that jus above?

How many As in the human genome? 

Since we will look for restrinction enzymes. Can you tell me how many cut sites there are for :

Pst1 CTGCAG
put a few others!
....
....
.... 

If you did not already, take into account the reverse strand when calculateing the number of sites!




In this exercise you played around with some basics data using pre-existing programs and the available help you could find (i.e. the instructors, colleagues, --help and Google). This is very much like real-life genomics!
