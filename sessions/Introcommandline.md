# Introduction to the command line

## 1. Getting on the supercomputer

During this session, we will learn to be comfortable with the command line. First, we will login to the server Mahuika. A resource maintained by the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI).
You should all have access to NeSI and we will start byt the logon to [Mahuika](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000163575-Mahuika), their newest resource.


* [NeSI login]()


```
cd /nesi/project/uooXXX/YOURUSERNAME/introunixfolder
```


## 2. Introduction to the command line

For this session, we will material under a Creative Commons license developped by The Carpentries. [The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/index.html) teaches foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The carpentries is active in New Zealand and @Otago, we encourage you to keep your eyes open for [local events](https://otagocarpentries.github.io/). All the content is at ```FILLINTHEPATH```

We will go through the following carpentries lessons together:

* [Navigating Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html)
* [Working With Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)
* [Pipes and Filters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter/index.html)
* [Finding things](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html)
* [Loops](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/index.html)

We have now gone through the basics of the command line. Let's reinforce some of what we just learnt in this [final exercise](sesssions/bashgenomics.md).
