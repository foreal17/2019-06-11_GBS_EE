# Introduction to the command line

## Getting on the supercomputer

During this session, we will learn to be comfortable with the command line. First, we will login to the server Mahuika. A resource maintained by the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI).
You should all have access to NeSI and we will start byt the logon to [Mahuika](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000163575-Mahuika), their newest resource.

You might have managed to log in to NeSI already. If you have not, please request help from one of us and we will assist you.

Once you login, get into a space that we created for you in this workshop:


```
cd /nesi/project/nesi02659/users/<yourusername>
```


## Introduction to the command line

For this session, we will material under use a Creative Commons license developped by The Carpentries. [The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/index.html) teaches foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The carpentries is active in New Zealand and @Otago, we encourage you to keep your eyes open for [local events](https://otagocarpentries.github.io/).

We will go through the following carpentries lessons together:

* [Navigating Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html)
* [Working With Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)
* [Pipes and Filters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter/index.html)
* [Finding things](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html)
* [Loops](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/index.html)

We have now gone through the basics of the command line. Let's reinforce some of what we just learnt in this [final exercise](bashgenomics.md).
