### 5.Since we are doing GBS we are interested in knowing how frequent restriction enzymes are . Can you tell me how many cut sites there are for :

	* PstI CTGCAG
	* ecoRI CTTAAG	
	* SbfI CCTGCAGG
  
  **HINT:** We are still looking for particular patterns, ```grep``` seems appropriate, look at the `--help` of grep to see if it can count.
