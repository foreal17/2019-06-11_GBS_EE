Since we are doing GBS we are interested in knowing how frequent restriction enzyme cut sites are. Can you tell me how many cut sites there are for:

	* PstI CTGCAG
	* ecoRI CTTAAG	
	* SbfI CCTGCAGG
  
  **HINT:** We are still looking for particular patterns, so ```grep``` seems appropriate. Look at the `--help` of grep to see if it can count.
